If the new position is unattainable, such a wall, the robot receives a "false" signal and stays put. If not, a "true" signal will move it. The robot is blind in the dark labyrinth. Develop algorithms and data structures to enable the robot reach the Exit. The robot gets a "win" signal at the Exit gate.</span>

                <h3>Enterprise Application Design</h3>
                <span class="project-description">After the COVID-19 epidemic, tourism grew proportionally. My team found that Ho Chi Minh City chauffeured car rental websites are not user-friendly, have many technical issues, and fail to attract users or give value. Given the amount of automobile rental firms, few websites offer car rental services. Thus, rental businesses had less possibilities to sell to customers. As more people book cars online, automobile rental firms have grown in popularity. However, our car rental website provides a driver with the rental vehicle. This is helpful for visitors who don't drive or don't know the region. Our experienced chauffeurs will get you there safely and on schedule. Our easy-to-use online reservation system lets you book a rental car and chauffeur in minutes for a worry-free holiday. Our automobile rental agency's website has everything you need for business or leisure travel. </span>

In most online flower stores, consumers input the flower name and peruse the results. Our business allows visitors to submit photographs of flowers to improve search results.
